//|From 1925 through 1963, Burma Shave advertising signs appeared next to highways all       |
//|across the United States. There were always four or five signs in a row containing pieces |
//|of a rhyme, followed by a sign that read "Burma Shave". For example, one set of signs     |
//|that has been preserved by the Smithsonian Insitution reads as follows:                   |
//|Shaving Brushes                                                                           |
//|You'll soon see 'em                                                                       |
//|On a shelf                                                                                |
